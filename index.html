<p>
I am a Director of Engineering at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, managing the amazing teams building <a href="https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/firefox-reality/">Firefox Reality</a> for VR and AR devices, <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/">Hubs by Mozilla</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> web engine, and whatever else needs doing for the team.
<p>
I got my Ph.D. from the University of Chicago's <a href="https://www.cs.uchicago.edu">Computer Science</a> department, studying under <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~jhr">Dr. John Reppy</a>. My Master’s paper was on the implementation of analysis and optimization passes in our parallel compiler, <a href="http://manticore.cs.uchicago.edu/">Manticore</a>. My Ph.D. research was on how to add mutation safely and efficiently into a functional parallel programming language. I've also been doing work on our runtime, garbage collector, and most recently some extensions to control-flow analysis.
<p>
Before that, over the course of seven years I was a manager and a developer at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Visual Studio</a> organization, working on next-generation software development tools technology out at the Redmond, WA offices.</p>
<p>
I have served on the PC or reviewed for PADL, HOPA, IFL, ML Workshop, LaME, Haskell, ICFP, PLDI, OOPSLA, DAMP, POPL, and the JFP.
<p>
I'm married with a son, and my hobby is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55pMHqIOrsc">powerlifting</a>.
